### JavaScript - Warm up

1. How to create variables and constants:
   Variables are declared using `let`, `let`, or `const` keywords in JavaScript. Constants are declared using `const`. Example:

   ```javascript
   let age = 25
   const pi = 3.14159
   ```

1. What are differences between let, const, and let:

   - `let` has function scope and can be redeclared within the same scope.
   - `const` and `let` have block scope and cannot be redeclared, but `const` values are immutable, while `let` values can be changed.

1. What are all the data types available in JavaScript:
   JavaScript has several data types, including `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, `function`, `null`, and `undefined`.

1. How to use the if, if...else statements:
   Conditional statements like `if` and `if...else` are used to control program flow based on conditions. Example:

   ```javascript
   if (condition) {
     // Code to execute if the condition is true
   } else {
     // Code to execute if the condition is false
   }
   ```

1. How to use comments:
   Comments in JavaScript are created using `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. They are used for documentation and code explanations.

1. How to assign values to variables:
   You can assign values to variables using the `=` operator. Example:

   ```javascript
   let name = 'John'
   ```

1. How to use while and for loops:
   `while` and `for` loops are used for repetitive tasks. Example of a `for` loop:

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     // Code to repeat five times
   }
   ```

1. How to use break and continue statements:
   `break` is used to exit a loop prematurely, while `continue` is used to skip the current iteration and continue to the next in a loop.

1. What is a function and how do you use functions:
   A function is a reusable block of code. You can define a function using the `function` keyword and call it by its name, passing arguments if necessary.

1. What does a function that does not use any return statement return:
   A function that does not have a `return` statement or explicitly returns a value will return `undefined` by default.

1. Scope of variables:
   Scope defines where a variable is accessible in your code. JavaScript has function scope and block scope for variables, depending on how they are declared.

1. What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them:
   Arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder respectively. They are used to perform mathematical operations.

1. How to manipulate a dictionary:
   In JavaScript, a "dictionary" can be represented as an object with key-value pairs. You can manipulate it by adding, modifying, or deleting properties using dot notation or square brackets.

1. How to import a file:
   In JavaScript, you can import files using different mechanisms depending on the environment. In Node.js, you use the `require` function, while in modern web browsers, you can use ES6 module syntax with `import`.
