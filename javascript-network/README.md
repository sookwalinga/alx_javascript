1. **How to manipulate JSON data in JavaScript:**

   - JavaScript provides methods for working with JSON data, such as `JSON.parse()` to convert a JSON string to a JavaScript object and `JSON.stringify()` to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string. You can manipulate JSON data by accessing and modifying the properties of JavaScript objects obtained from parsed JSON.

2. **How to use request and fetch API in JavaScript:**

   - The `request` module is commonly used for making HTTP requests in Node.js, while the `fetch` API is used in web browsers to make asynchronous HTTP requests. To use `request` in Node.js, you typically require the module and use its methods like `request.get()` or `request.post()`. For `fetch`, you use the `fetch()` function to send HTTP requests and handle the response using Promises.

3. **How to read and write a file using the fs module in JavaScript:**
   - In Node.js, the `fs` (file system) module allows you to read and write files. You can read a file using methods like `fs.readFile()` or `fs.readFileSync()`, and write to a file using methods like `fs.writeFile()` or `fs.writeFileSync()`. These functions provide options for encoding, handling errors, and asynchronous or synchronous file operations.
